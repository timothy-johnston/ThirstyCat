# ThirstyCat
### A Raspberry Pi & Python powered cat detector + a full-stack Java and Spring Boot web app.
#### Featuring my wonderful cat, Shasta. Because, well, I take the term *pet* project very seriously.

## About

**ThirstyCat is a two part project, incorporating both hardware and software.**

**The hardware component** is a pressure-sensitive platform built with a Raspberry Pi, force sensing resistor, and PiCam and placed in front of Shasta's water bowl. A Python script continuously reads the sensor's pressure data waiting for the values to exceed some threshold; when the cat steps on the platform to take a drink, the threshold is exceeded, and the PiCam is triggered to snap a photo. The script then uses the Twitter API to tweet the photo from the @TheThirstyCat Twitter and persists it to a database (see the software description below).

**The software component** is a full-stack Java and Spring boot web application deployed on AWS with Elastic Beanstalk. The application's back end is a REST API secured with JWT Bearer Authentication allowing for the persistence and retrieval of the photos captured by the PiCam. The front end is a fairly simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript UI secured with Basic Authentication allowing users to create an account, view and save the automatically captured photos, and view CatStats (CatStats:  Pretty graphs detailing Shasta's drinking habits!).

## Setup and Installation
### Hardware
I've put together a guide on [how to set up the Raspberry Pi + force sensing resistor + PiCam](https://github.com/timothy-johnston/ThirstyCat/blob/master/cat-detector-how-to.md). 

### Software
Setup for this project is pretty simple and straightforward. You'll want to have installed Java, MySQL, and your IDE/editor of choice.
#### Database
All we need to do is create the database; Hibernate will handle the rest, including table creation. From the terminal, cd into /ThirstyCat/webApp/thirstyCat/database and run the following command:
```bash
./create-database.sh
```
Alternatively, you yourself can fire up a MySQL connection and manually create the database with
```sql
CREATE DATABASE thirstycat;
```
#### Java Source Code
Nothing too tricky here, just a couple environment variables to set up:

| Key  | Value Description |
| :------------: |:---------------:|
| JWT_CRED_1      | An admin JWT username |
| JWT_CRED_1      | An admin JWT password         |
| JWT_SECRET | Secret key to sign JWT        |

This app runs on Spring Boot's embedded Tomcat server, so no need to configure or set up a web server.  Additionally, no need to do anything special to connect the front & back ends, as that is handled by the Thymeleaf templating engine.
